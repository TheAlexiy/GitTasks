It's been a long time coming
I'm coming back for you, my friend
To where we'd hide as children
I'm coming back for you, my friend

Though my memories are faded
They come back to haunt me once again
And though my mind is somewhat jaded
Now it's time for me to strike again
Tonight

It's a hunter's moon

Under a headstone, sister
I'm dying to see you, my friend
Back in the old cemetery
I'm dying to see you, my friend

Though my memories are faded
They come back to haunt me once again
And though my mind is somewhat jaded
Now it's time for me to strike again
Tonight
